Let's create something cool together.

## Getting Started - right way

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit a Github issue for this Repo
  - Clearly describe the issue
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work
  - This is usually the master branch
  - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch
  - To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b fix/my_awesome_change`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch
- Make commits of logical and atomic units
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format:
  - Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
  - Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed"
  - Capitalize the subject line
- Push changes
- Create Pull Request
